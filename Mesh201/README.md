## What is Mesh 201?

The *Mesh 201* tutorial project is intended for intermediate to advanced Unity developers with an introduction to the fundamental Mesh Toolkit building blocks thus enabling them to hone their skills and create delightful experiences with the Mesh Toolkit. In the Mesh 201 tutorial project, we demonstrate building shared immersive environments and experiences in Mesh using Mesh WebSlates, Mesh Visual Scripting, Mesh Cloud Scripting, and Azure OpenAI.

Developers start with a pre-built Unity project, where they can complete a series of tasks to add custom interactivity and other Mesh features, and then deploy the project as an Environment to Microsoft Mesh. The project has 2 Scenes:

* **FinishedProject.unity**: This scene contains a completed version of the tutorial.
* **StartingPoint.unity**: It contains a pre-built scene where Mesh features can be added by following the tutorial.

In this tutorial, you'll complete a series of tasks that use Mesh Visual Scripting and Mesh Physics to create an experience that can be uploaded and used in Mesh.
